Question:

Write a Python program that calculates the compound interest for a given principal amount, annual interest rate, the number of times interest is compounded per year, and the number of years. 

Use the compound interest formula:
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:

A is the final amount (including principal and interest).
P is the principal amount.
r is the annual interest rate (decimal form).
n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
t is the number of years.

Your program should ask the user for these values and then calculate and display the final amount with two decimal places.

Sample Input:

Principal amount (P): 1000
Annual interest rate (r, in percentage): 5
Number of times interest is compounded per year (n): 4
Number of years (t): 5

Sample Output:

The final amount after 5 years is  $1282.04

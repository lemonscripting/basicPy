Question:

You are designing a pulley system for lifting a 500 kg weight. 
The pulley system consists of two pulleys, one with a radius of X meters and the other with a radius of Y meters. 
A rope is wrapped around both pulleys. 
Using Python's math library, calculate the mechanical advantage of this pulley system. 
Mechanical advantage is defined as the ratio of the force applied to lift the weight to the weight itself. Round your answer to two decimal places.

Sample Input:

Weight (in kilograms): 500
Radius of Large Pulley (in meters): 0.2
Radius of Small Pulley (in meters): 0.1

Sample Output:

Mechanical Advantage: 5.00



HINTS [TRY NOT TO LOOK AT THIS]

To solve this problem, you can use the following formula for mechanical advantage:

Mechanical Advantage = (Radius of Large Pulley) / (Radius of Small Pulley)

Calculate this ratio using the provided input values, and round the result to two decimal places.

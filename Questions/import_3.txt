Question:

You are working on a physics experiment where you need to calculate the escape velocity of an object from the surface of a planet. 
The planet has a mass of X kilograms, and its radius is Y meters. 
Using Python's math library, determine the escape velocity required for an object to leave the planet's gravitational field. 
Round your answer to two decimal places in meters per second (m/s).
You are given tha G = 6.67430e-11 [Universal gravitational constant in mÂ³ kg^(-1) s^(-2)]
Sample Input:

Planet Mass (in kilograms): 5.97e24
Planet Radius (in meters): 6.371e6

Sample Output:

Escape Velocity: 11187.58 m/s



HINTS [TRY NOT TO LOOK AT THIS]

To calculate the escape velocity, you can use the formula:

Escape Velocity = sqrt((2 * G * Planet Mass) / Planet Radius)

Where G is the universal gravitational constant. You can use the math library to perform this calculation and round the result to two decimal places.
